# It a web application on online comparison of online shop
This project is built with **HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, JQuery and AJAX**. I have used **MVC** approach to view data and manipulate DOM.

The SQL file is also given here. I have used **MySql** as my database. The database is populated by **Web Scraping** with the help of some **Python scripts** which are also done by my. Those wil be uploaded in other repository. 

What this project does is, it compares price of a product from different onoine shops and views the customer the most cost effective one. One can simply search a product in the search-bar and a list of the products appears with information about the online shop, per unit price and package price. In this way it gives the user a good overview of the products. Also there is a segment to show which products they have selected and where they have to go to grab the product. I also shows total cost of the list the user have made.
